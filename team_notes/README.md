# Team Notes

This directory is dedicated to personal development notes, ideas, and technical logs from each team member throughout the development of the **AudioLink** project.

## Structure

Each file contains one team member’s individual insights, debugging sessions, research notes, sketches, or implementation ideas. These documents are informal and serve as a behind-the-scenes look at the engineering process.

> All members contributed collaboratively to the **embedded systems** aspects of AudioLink. The roles below highlight individual specializations within the team.

### Current Members:
- `corey_notes`: Corey Hoang – Project Lead, DSP chain developer, firmware architecture
- `jonathan_notes`: Jonathan Dittloff – PCB design, power systems, electrical engineering
- `rolando_notes`: Rolando Aguirre – Raspberry Pi integration, touchscreen UI, middleware

> These files are not part of the final deliverable and may include raw brainstorming or in-progress content. They reflect thought processes, not polished documentation.

## Why This Matters

Keeping track of ideas, bugs, and design decisions individually helps:
- Trace design rationale
- Share challenges and solutions
- Prepare for documentation, IP, and publishing
